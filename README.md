# DevTown_Submission

This repository contains the submission for the hiring process of DevTown. The project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine-learning techniques. It includes a Python implementation of the heart disease prediction model, an explanation video, and a guidance note.

# Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

HeartDiseasePrediction.ipynb: This colab notebook contains the implementation of the heart disease prediction model. It uses machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, naive bayes, SVM, KNN, decision tree, random forest, xgboost and artificial neural network to train on the provided dataset and make predictions.

explanation_video_final.mp4: This video provides a detailed explanation of the project, including the problem statement, dataset description, model architecture, and evaluation metrics. It serves as a visual guide to understanding the project's key aspects. Due to the github's upload limit, I had to upload a compressed video.
